Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games
We got everything you want honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey we got your disease
</p>
<p>
Jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Uh I, I wanna watch you bleed
</p>
<p>
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price to pay
And you're a very sexy girl, very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
Uh, I, I want to hear you scream
</p>
<p>

Welcome to the jungle, it gets worse here every day
You learn to live like an animal in the jungle where we play
If you got hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually
You can have everything you want but you better not take it from me
</p>
<p>
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Uh ah, I'm gonna watch you bleed
</p>
<p>
And when you're high you never ever wanna come down
So down, so down, so down, yeah
</p>
<p>
You know where you are?
You're in the jungle baby
You're gonna die
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your shun n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n knees, knees
Down the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to you
It's gonna bring you down, huh
